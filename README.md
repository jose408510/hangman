# hangman

Hangman style game with a theme based on the "Wild West" 

User inputs a guess letter If it is in the current word/phrase then the letter will show in all places it is present If the letter is not present, then the number of guesses left decreases and the letter is added to the section "Letters already guessed" Once/if all letters of the word/phrase are guessed correctly, win count goes up and a new word/phrase to guess is displayed If all of the words/phrases are cleared, then user wins

The goal of this project was to use our currently learned skills in integrating html, css and javascript(logic) together into the design and presentation of a game.
